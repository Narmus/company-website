      "What’s the first place you go to when trying to find a product/service? That’s easy, it’s Google. So, it’s also natural that Google is the best site for online reviews. Google is especially significant if you’re a local business, so make sure you spend time setting up your Google Business profile and making your business discoverable.",

      "Now that Facebook has such a large user base, it’s also becoming one of the most popular sites for reviews. It’s also simple for users to leave reviews on Facebook—most of them already have an account. This means that, unlike other sites, they don’t need to create an account or log in each time they visit again.",

      "This is the place where most people go when organizing a trip. So, if you’re a hotel, a restaurant, or own any other business that welcomes tourists, you should definitely pay attention to TripAdvisor. Travelers submit reviews, comments, and upload images, so the advice is pretty reliable and influential.",
